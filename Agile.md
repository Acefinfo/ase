# Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), SSADM

## Scrum

Scrum is one of the most popular agile frameworks where the project is broken down into multiple smaller iterative cycles, called **sprints**. It's designed to boost collaboration, increase transparency, and encourage continuous improvement.

### Scrum Methodology

There are 5 methodologies:

1. Initiation
2. Planning
3. Implementation
4. Review
5. Release

### Features of Scrum

- Scrum is a lightweight framework.
- Scrum emphasizes self-organization.
- Scrum is simple to understand.
- Scrum framework helps the team to work together.

### Advantages

- Fast moving and cost-efficient.
- Customer satisfaction is prioritized.
- Scrum feedback relies on constant feedback, which improves the quality of the product in less time.

### Disadvantages

- It can be difficult to plan, structure, and organize a project without a clear definition.
- The daily Scrum meeting and frequent reviews require substantial resources.

## Kanban

Kanban is an Agile-based workflow management method that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and improving the efficiency of processes. It uses a Kanban board divided into columns (e.g., **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**) to help teams monitor and optimize their workflow.

### Features of Kanban

- Visualizes workflow representation on a board.
- Focuses on continuous delivery instead of fixed iterations.
- Work in Progress (WIP) limits to avoid overloading team members.
- Highly flexible, allowing tasks to be added or reprioritized.

### Advantages of Kanban

- Improves workflow and transparency through visual boards.
- Increases efficiency by limiting multitasking.
- Reduces bottlenecks by highlighting slow areas in the process.

### Disadvantages of Kanban

- If WIP limits are not followed, the board can become disorganized.
- No defined roles, which may create ambiguity in larger teams.

## Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile methodology focused on improving software quality and enabling teams to respond quickly to changing customer requirements. XP emphasizes frequent releases, customer collaboration, and strong engineering practices.

### Features of XP

- Pair programming (two developers working together).
- Test-driven development (TDD).
- Small and frequent releases for quick feedback.
- Refactoring to improve code quality continuously.

### Advantages

- High-quality code due to strong engineering practices.
- Rapid response to changing customer needs.
- Low defect rates because testing is integrated into the development cycle.
- Encourages team communication and collaboration.

### Disadvantages

- Requires highly skilled and disciplined developers.
- Frequent customer involvement is necessary, which may not always be possible.
- Pair programming and continuous testing can be resource-intensive.

## Difference of 3 Types

| **Aspect**               | **Scrum**                                    | **Kanban**                                    | **Extreme Programming (XP)**                   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**                | Managing and completing projects in iterations. | Optimizing flow and efficiency of work.       | Technical excellence, customer collaboration, and high-quality code. |
| **Approach**             | Prescriptive framework with defined roles, events, and artifacts. | Visual flow system; focuses on continuous delivery and reducing bottlenecks. | Focus on engineering practices (e.g., TDD, Pair Programming). |
| **Timebox**              | Fixed-length sprints (typically 1–4 weeks).  | No fixed timeframes; continuous delivery.    | Iterations (typically 1–2 weeks), but focuses on continuous improvement and coding practices. |
| **Roles**                | Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team. | No prescribed roles; any team members can contribute to managing flow. | Developers, Testers, Customers (collaborative). |
| **Artifacts**            | Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.  | Kanban Board (To Do, In Progress, Done).      | User Stories, Test Cases, Codebase.           |
| **Ceremonies/Events**    | Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective. | No specific ceremonies; just continuous flow. | Daily Standup, Pair Programming, Refactoring, Continuous Integration. |
| **Work Management**      | Work is broken into tasks in a Sprint, with progress reviewed regularly. | Work is pulled based on capacity; WIP (Work In Progress) limits are applied. | Work is iterated quickly, focusing on software features and testing. |
| **Key Goal**             | Deliver features iteratively with feedback and improve processes. | Maximize work efficiency and reduce bottlenecks by improving flow. | Create high-quality software quickly and iteratively with technical best practices. |
| **Flexibility**          | Moderate: Has a structure but allows flexibility within the framework. | High: Adaptable to changing priorities and workflows. | Moderate: Structured around engineering practices, but flexible in iteration management. |
| **Target Outcome**       | Product Increment delivered at the end of each Sprint. | Continuous flow of work and continuous delivery of value. | High-quality, working software that meets customer needs. |
| **Main Focus**           | Process management and iterative delivery.   | Flow optimization and continuous delivery.   | Software quality, customer feedback, and technical excellence. |
| **Tools**                | Scrum Board, Burn Down Chart.                | Kanban Board.                                | TDD, Pair Programming, Continuous Integration, Refactoring. |

## SSADM (Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method)

SSADM is a waterfall-based, document-driven methodology used mainly in government and large organizations. It emphasizes detailed documentation, structured analysis, and a logical progression of stages to develop information systems.

### Features of SSADM

- Highly structured and formal approach.
- Divided into clearly defined phases: analysis, design, implementation.
- Uses data flow diagrams, entity relationship models, and logical data structures.

### Advantages of SSADM

- Ensures thorough understanding of requirements before development.
- Produces consistent and detailed documentation.
- Reduces ambiguity through structured techniques.
- Suitable for large or complex projects with stable requirements.

### Disadvantages of SSADM

- Time-consuming because of heavy documentation.
- Not flexible; changes are difficult to accommodate once a phase is completed.
- Less suitable for dynamic or rapidly changing projects.
- The whole process can be costly for smaller teams or organizations.
