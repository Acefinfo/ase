Scrum

Scrum is one of the most popular agile framework where the project is broken down into multiple smaller iterative cycle which are called sprints. It's designed to boost collaboration, increasing collaboration, increasing transparency and continuously improvement.



Scrum methodology

There are 5 methodologies:

Initiation

Planning

implementation

Review

Release



Features of Scrum

Scrum is light weighted framework.

Scrum emphasizes self organization

Scrum is simple to understand.

Scrum framework helps the team to work together.



Advantage

Fast moving and money efficient

Customer satisfaction is important

As scrim feed back rely on constant feedback therefore the quality of product increases in less amount of time.

Disadvantage

It can be difficult for the scrum to plan structure and organize a project that lacks clear definition.

The daily Scrum meeting and frequent meetings and review require substantial resources.









Kanban

Kanban is an Agile-based workflow management method that focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and improving the efficiency of processes. It uses a Kanban board divided into columns (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) to help teams monitor and optimize their workflow.



Features of Kanban

Visualize work flow representation on a board.

Focus on continuous delivery instead of fixing iterations.

work in progress limits to avoid overloading team members.

Highly flexible allowing task to be added or reprioritized.





Advantage of Kanban

Improves workflow and transparency through visual boards.

Increases efficiency by limiting multitasking.

Reduces bottlenecks by highlighting slow areas in the process.



Disadvantage of Kanban

If WIP limits are not followed board can become disorganized.

No defined role which may create ambiguity in larger teams.





Extreme programming(XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile methodology focused on improving software quality and enabling teams to respond quickly to changing customer requirements. XP emphasizes frequent releases, customer collaboration, and strong engineering practices.



Features of XP

Pair programming (Two developer working together)

Test driven development(TDD)

Small and frequent releases for quick feedback.

Refactoring to improve code quality continuously.



Advantage

High quality code due to strong engineering practices.

Rapid response to changing customer response.

Low defect rates because of testing is integrated into development cycle.

Encourage team communication and collaboration.



Disadvantage

Requires highly skilled and disciplined developers.

Frequent customer involvement is necessary which may not always be possible.4

Pair programming and continuous testing may be resource intensive.

| \*\*Focus\*\*             | Managing and completing projects in iterations.                          | Optimizing flow and efficiency of work.                                      | Technical excellence, customer collaboration, and high-quality code.                          |

| \*\*Approach\*\*          | Prescriptive framework with defined roles, events, and artifacts.        | Visual flow system; focuses on continuous delivery and reducing bottlenecks. | Focus on engineering practices (e.g., TDD, Pair Programming).                                 |

| \*\*Timebox\*\*           | Fixed-length sprints (typically 1–4 weeks).                              | No fixed timeframes; continuous delivery.                                    | Iterations (typically 1–2 weeks), but focuses on continuous improvement and coding practices. |

| \*\*Roles\*\*             | Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team.                           | No prescribed roles; any team members can contribute to managing flow.       | Developers, Testers, Customers (collaborative).                                               |

| \*\*Artifacts\*\*         | Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.                              | Kanban Board (To Do, In Progress, Done).                                     | User Stories, Test Cases, Codebase.                                                           |

| \*\*Ceremonies/Events\*\* | Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.       | No specific ceremonies; just continuous flow.                                | Daily Standup, Pair Programming, Refactoring, Continuous Integration.                         |

SSADM (Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method)

SSADM is a waterfall-based, document-driven methodology used mainly in government and large organizations. It emphasizes detailed documentation, structured analysis, and a logical progression of stages to develop information systems.



Features of SSADM

Highly structured and formal approach.

Divided into clearly defined phages: analysis. design, implementation.

Uses data flow diagram, entity relationship models and logical data structure.



Advantage of SSADM

Ensures through understanding of requirement before development.

Produces consistent and detailed document.

Reduces ambiguity through structured technique.

Suitable for large or complex project with stable requirements.



Disadvantage of SSADM

Time consuming because of heavy documentation.

Not flexible, changes are difficult to accommodate once a phage is completed.

Less suitable for dynamic or rapidly changing projects.

Whole process can be cost for smaller teams of organization.
